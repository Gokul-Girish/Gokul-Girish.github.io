**Hey, I'm Gokul**

I am a master's graduate in Systems Biology, interested in  understanding how the brain computes information.

I study the brain by combining **behavioural assays**, **neurophysiology**, and **mathematical modelling**.

You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gokulgirish.bsky.social) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokul-girish/).
